# Population genetic Classes

This is a set of classes around topics of populations genetics targeting
students of population genetics at various levels.

These have notably been given during the class _DNA analysis in population
genetics course_ in 2020.

These classes are organized around R and show how it can be used to analyze
genetic data using various packages for population genetics, most notably:

- coala
- adegenet
- ape
- learnPopGen
- pegas
- vcfR

The classes are given here in Rmarkdown, a format that can be easily converted
to various format. However, the files provided here are built assuming they
would be converted using pandoc to the pdf format using latex and beamer.

TODO:
- example of conversion with pandoc
- note about the additional files required (example data)
- citation?
